# How to contribute

You can find the chapters you want to contribute in the [table of contents](SUMMARY.md). If the chapter has not been claimed by others, you can declare that you want to complete it by [creating an Issue](https://github.com/pingcap-incubator/tidb-in-action/issues/new).

Format of the articles uses [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). After you finish the article, you can submit the content through [Create PR](https://github.com/pingcap-incubator/tidb-in-action/compare). For the details, please refer to the Github documentation [Creating a pull request] (https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Image directory

 Please put images in the `res/img/chapterX` directory. For example, the images in the article `chapter1/tidb-intro.md` should be placed in the `res/img/chapter1/tidb-intro/` directory.
